# Network Layer
- One of the protocols used in the Network Layer is IP.
- Network Layer is concerned with the delivery of a packet across multiple networks.
- This layer is backbone of OSI model
- Selects and transfers best logical path for data transfer between nodes.
- Layer contains hardware devices such as:
    - Routers
    - Bridges
    - Firewalls
    - Switches
- Despite of the involvement of the hardware devices it creates a logical image of most efficient communication route and implements it with a physical medium
- Router examines header fields of all IP packets that pass through it.


- This layer responds to requests from layer above it (transport layer) and issues requests to layer below it (data-link layer).
